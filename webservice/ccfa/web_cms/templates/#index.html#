  We thus aim to create a Microbiome Consortium Data Coordinating
  Center (JDRF-MCDCC), which will create a schema for data and metadata
  organization that is driven by JDRF consortium consensus; implement
  scalable tools for data storage, retrieval, and integration; implement
  a web interface for data retrieval and deposition; and support and
  train the microbiome consortium. Facilitation of the JDRF-MCDCC will
  leverage our existing experience in comparable bioinformatics centers
  for the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America; our work with the
  Human Microbiome Project (HMP) and "HMP2" Center for Characterizing
  the Gut Microbial Ecosystem in Inflammatory Bowel Disease
  (http://ibdmdb.org); our ongoing collaborations and analyses of the
  DIABIMMUNE and TEDDY microbiomes (in total nearly 20,000 samples); and
  the computational infrastructure of the Harvard University Faculty of
  Arts and Sciences Research Computing and the Broad Institute
  information technology teams. Our goal is to provide the greatest
  cost-benefit to the JDRF and its Microbiome Consortium members by
  sharing common infrastructure, software, and protocols to help
  accelerate translation of discoveries in the microbiome into
  actionable T1D diagnostics and therapies.
